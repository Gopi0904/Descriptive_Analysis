Project Summary :- 
 I analyzed household data using Python.
 I identified numerical and categorical data.
 I calculated mean, median, and mode for income and age.
 I calculated range, variance, standard deviation, and IQR to understand data spread.
 I used histograms and boxplots to see the distribution of income and family size.
 I compared income based on education level and urban/rural areas.
 I studied the relationship between age and income using graphs.
 I learned how to understand data and basic statistics using Python.
